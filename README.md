# Adpearance Boilerplate: What it is

This boilerplate is a front-end template built internally by Adpearance designers and developers
for use in the building of all new adpative sites.

The Adpearance boilerplate is not meant to include any specific styles (color, typography) so as to allow for
optimum creativity when it comes to designing the remaining front-end.

What it *does* include is a robust set of UI elements and a responsive grid, all of which can be further
customized with the use of SASS variables.


## Rules of Use

1.  Download and use files on your new project server/directory.
     You may not edit and change the core boilerplate.

2.  Set up SASS and Compass (you MUST use both) for your workflow.
     Ideally, this is set up on the server, but in most cases, the developer uses a local compiler.

3.  NEVER EVER EVER EVER edit the screen.css file.  This will be immediately written over as soon as SASS is compiled.
     Seriously, if you do, your arms will shrivel up past your elbows and everyone will laugh and point at you and call you "T-Rex Man"
     and you can never do pushups or floss your teeth again.

4.  Take time to explore the files.
     Comments have been included within the SASS files to show correct HTML markup for certain UI elements.

5.  Because many of the UI elements are based on Foundation 4, you can go to
     http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/ for further instructions.

6.  The 'Global' directory includes UI components that are not template specific.
     Page or template group specific styles should be added in the 'Modules' directory (i.e. header, footer, etc.).

7.  Always use front-end best practices.
